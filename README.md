# OpenSolarCoolingHub Documentation Index

**Solar Powered IoT Cooling Hubs**  
_This is a project that brings together architecture, electronics, Internet of Things (IoT), and solar engineering to create affordable and sustainable cooling systems specifically designed for off-grid communities. By integrating smart design with energy-efficient technology and renewable energy sources, the project aims to provide reliable cooling solutions where access to electricity is limited or unavailable. The goal is to improve quality of life, reduce post-harvest losses, and support health and food storage needs in remote or underserved areas._

## 🔗 Cold Room Exterior
This image shows the exterior design of the solar-powered cold room, constructed with durable, insulated materials to maintain optimal internal temperatures. The structure is optimized for energy efficiency and environmental resilience, making it ideal for use in rural or off-grid locations. Its compact and modular design allows for easy transport, installation, and maintenance in remote areas.

## 🔗 IOT Sytem PCB
Displayed here is the custom-designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the IoT system. This board forms the core of the system’s electronics, managing sensor data, control signals, and wireless communication. The PCB is engineered to interface with temperature, humidity, and door sensors, and is optimized for low power consumption and real-time data transmission, supporting remote monitoring and control via a web dashboard.

## 🔗 Live IoT Dashboard  
The live IoT dashboard provides real-time monitoring of environmental conditions inside the cold room. It displays key metrics such as temperature, humidity, and system status, allowing users to remotely track and manage performance. The intuitive interface makes it easy for operators to respond to alerts and optimize energy use, ensuring food and medical supplies remain safely stored.
